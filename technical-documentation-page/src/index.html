      <h4>Types of Drill Bits</h4>
    </header>
      <article>
        <p>
          Drill bits differ based on shape, purpose, material and length, but the basic principles of use are common to allâ€”they are an effective and efficient way to drill holes in materials. 
      </p>
        <ul class="list1">
  <li>Add <code>.list-group-flush</code> to remove some borders and rounded corners to render list group items edge-to-edge in a parent container.</li>
  </ul>
      <p>
      Drill bits can be used on wood, metal, plastic or, in same cases, porcelain, and due to the broad ranger of drill bit configurations available, they can make a variety of holes for many different applications and purposes. 
<br>
    As the options for drill bits for a given application can be daunting, it is helpful to look into the different bit specifications and configurations before choosing the proper bit for the job.

      <h5>Twist Bit</h5>
    </header>
  <article>
    <p>
    The oldest type of bit, the twist bit was invented in 1863 by Steven Morse. Its name is descriptive, as the bit is simply a long cylinder of metal with grooves on opposite sides which has been twisted to form a screw-type shape. 
    </p>
    <ul class="list2">
  <li>The <code>push()</code> method adds one or more elements to the end of an array and returns the new length of the array.</li>
  </ul>
    <p>
    In addition to its originary status, the twist bit is also one of the more common drill bits as it can function on metal, wood and plastic. Twist bits can be long, wide and feature different thread angles to ensure faster drilling or prevent breakage in different courser, stronger materials, such as steel.

  <section class="main-section" id="Gun_Drill">
    <header>
      <h5>Gun Drill</h5>
    </header>
  <article>
    <p>
    A more complicated bit, the gun drill is available in two basic set ups, internal and external. The function of both is the same, as it filters coolant into the hole being drilled while flushing out the swarf and chips created by the drilling process. 
    </p>
    <ul class="list3">
  <li>Use <a>s or <button>s to create actionable list group items with hover, disabled, and active states by adding .list-group-item-action.</li>
  </ul>
    <p>
    The internal method has a hollow area running through the main cylindrical section, and the coolant flushes out the chips. The external method flushes chips out in the standard format.
    </p>

  <section class="main-section" id="Center_Drill">
    <header>
      <h5>Center Drill</h5>
    </header>
  <article>
    <p>
    The center drill bit has a tapered screw thread as a tip, used for drilling holes into wood. Directly behind the screw thread is a radial spur which increases the size of the hole. 
    </p>
    <ul class="list4">
  <li>The function <code>selectAll()</code> highlights all the text in the input field so the user can, for example, copy or delete the ext.
</li>
  </ul>
   <p>
    The center bit is easy for hand use because the torque alone can draw the bit deeper in to the wood, but electric versions are also available.
    </p>

<!-- Section 5 -->
  <section class="main-section" id="Forstner_Bit">
  <header>
    <h5>Forstner Bit</h5>
  </header>
  <article>
    <p>
    The Forstner bit comes in many different drill shapes, but their primary purpose is to create holes in wood that have flat bottoms. 
    </p>
    <ul class="list5">
  <li><pre><code class="language-pascal">var i: Integer;
begin
i := 1;
end.</code></pre>
</li>
  </ul>
    <p>
    This bottom is only sullied by the small pointed tip used to guide the bit during drilling. Additionally, Forstner bits cannot automatically remove wood chips so they have to be removed from holes occasionally for clearing.
